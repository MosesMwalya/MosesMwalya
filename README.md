# List of my Projects
## 1. Marketing Mix Model
   
A sizeable amount of our organization's OPEX is allocated to marketing. Marketers generally agree that there is an investment level that will yield the best results in achieving the goal. Consequently, investing   below that threshold results in lower returns, while investing above it leads to both the achievement of the goal and the loss of some capital. Organization's aim is to achieve marketing objective efficiently and effectively.

The goal of the marketing mix model is to ascertain the ideal amount of investment necessary for successful marketing. From marketing mix model, the project also

    - Gives an overview of the net effect of past marketing decisions
    
    - Provides a model to evaluate outcome of various investment decisions; The "What-ifs scenario analysis"
    
    - Gives the most optimal investment for a given marketing initiative

  
  ***The overall outcome of this project was realized 22% saving on marketing budget with same amount of delivery*** 

## 2. Conjoint Analysis

Understanding that customers are faced with many product choices when making purchase decisions, we wanted to elevate our position to ensure customer would most likely choose our products any time they are faced with purchase decision.

Faced with that challenge, I resolved to undertake conjoint analysis - a statistical technique pivotal in decoding what drives purchasing decisions. By presenting customers with various product options and analyzing their choices, I identified the specific attributes they value most. This method allowed business to simulate real-world decision-making processes, revealing deep insights into customer priorities.
The findings helped business prioritize product features that deliver the highest value, enabling us to tailor our offerings to meet customer needs more effectively. 

***This data-driven approach not only enhanced our product development process but also fine-tuned our marketing strategies, driving customer satisfaction and 12% business growth in 2023/2024***

## 3. Customer Segmentation

In today's highly competitive market, understanding our customers' unique needs and behaviors remains crucial. Customer segmentation project was to help business understand customers better - making it possible to offer personalized experience, create relevant propositions as well as deliver efficient marketing. Further, we determined that it was going to empower us to connect with our customers on a deeper level, ensuring we meet their needs more effectively and create lasting value for them and our business.

***Through this project, we not only improved our customer experience but also drove business growth by aligning our strategies more closely with customer needs - this saw reduction of churn rate by 8% in 2023/2024 compared to previous year.***

## 4. Value Driver Modelling

Since advent of Covid, our customers continue to face difficult economic environment aggrevated by impacts of global warming, geopolitical interests as well as unfavourable regulatory framework governments have implemented in response to growing challenges. In view of that and understanding there is obvious decline in their income, customers have resorted to trade-offs for survival as a coping mechanism; they only purchase brands, products or services they consider to offer value. From previous studies, we had established that Value is more than Price.

It therefore becomes necessary to understand the meaning and drivers of ***VALUE*** to customers - sort of, which 'nats and bolts' we need to loosen or tighten for us to be able to achieve our objective.

Understanding that my organization is a data driven business, I undertook a *VALUE Driver Modelling* to close that gap.

***This study helped the business to re-jig value offering,  marketing activities thereby delivering 9% growth of customer base, 12% overall sales growth in 2023/2024.***

## 5. Recommendation Model

As our product portfolio continued to grow due to need for us to offer hyper-personalized service to our customers, it became necessary to recommend certain product propositions to target customers only.  As customer expectations for tailored interactions grow, generic recommendations fail to capture their interest or meet their needs. Challenge was to identify the right customers for a given product or service.
I developed a recommender model for one of our a product category that was its infancy stages - to predict and suggest propositions that were most likely to appeal to each individual. This concept not only enhances the customer experience by making it more relevant and engaging but also helps in efficiently navigating large catalogs, thereby reducing choice overload and decision fatigue.

***The model has managed to offer highly personalized purchase experiences, which has led to increased engagement (by 7%) and higher conversion rates (additional 11%). The model's ability to suggest relevant products has boosted cross-selling and upselling opportunities, driving 19% incremental revenue.***
